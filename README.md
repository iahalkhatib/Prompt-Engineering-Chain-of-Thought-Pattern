# Prompt Engineering Chain of Thought Pattern

Learning the Chain-of-Thought Approach to Prompt Engineering

The chain-of-thought approach is like guiding the AI through a series of related questions. 
This helps the AI understand the context and how to think step-by-step to get the right answer.
It's like solving a big puzzle by breaking it down into smaller pieces.

# How Does It Work?

Break Down the Task: Divide a big problem into smaller, simpler questions that build on each other.
Provide Examples with Answers: Before asking the main question, give the AI related questions with their correct answers to show how to solve them.
Guide the AI: Use these smaller questions to help the AI understand the reasoning process.

Ex. 

Sarah has 2 oranges. She eats 1 orange. The next day, she buys 3 more oranges. How many oranges does she have now?

Solution: Sarah had 2 oranges. She ate 1, so she had 2 - 1 = 1 orange left. The next day she bought 3 more, so she has 1 + 3 = 4 oranges now.

Prompt. 

Now, Alex has 3 apples. He buys 4 bags of apples. Each bag has 5 apples. How many apples does he have now?

By giving the related question and its solution, you help the AI understand how to think through the problem.
So, when the AI sees the final question, it can use the same logic to find the answer.

# Benefits of the Chain-of-Thought Approach

Better Understanding: Helps the AI understand complex problems by breaking them down.
Step-by-Step Thinking: Encourages the AI to solve problems logically.
Improved Answers: Leads to more accurate and understandable answers by showing the reasoning process.


# Conclusion 

By giving the AI related questions and answers, it learns how to solve similar problems using the same logic.

Using this approach, I can make better prompts that guide AI models to give better responses.
